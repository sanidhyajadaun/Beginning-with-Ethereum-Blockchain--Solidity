# **Beginning with Ethereum Blockchain - Solidity**

This repository is for anyone who is new to Etherum blockchain. It introduces you with wiriting smart contracts and other basics of solidity.

#

## **First Smart Contract**

Before writing the "First smart contract" I learnt about the different versions of the Solidity and then about the variables type. This contract simply allows you to print your message to the user with a globally assigned variable. 

#

## **Modifiers in Solidity**

In the modifiers program I have used the constructor, functions and the data hiding method to allow the contract accessible to only a specific user. 

#

## **Struts**

As we know Struct is simply we are defining our own data type or we can say creating a collection of primitive data type and creating our own data type. Therefore, in this section a program which stores student details and returns student roll no.
#

## **View vs Pure**

First of all let us know the basic difference between View vs Pure

Pure function declares that no state variable will be changed or read. view tells us that by running the function, no data will be saved/changed. pure tells us that not only does the function not save any data to the blockchain, but it also doesn't read any data from the blockchain.

In the Program file I have used both pure and view according to the differences.

## **Error handling**

assert() :
1) Useful for internal error
2) Useful for completely unexpected scenario
3) Use assert rarely

require() :
1) Useful for general purpose error
2) We use require so often in code for error handling
