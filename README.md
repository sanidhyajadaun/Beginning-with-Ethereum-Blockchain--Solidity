# **Beginning with Ethereum Blockchain - Solidity**

This repository is for anyone who is new to Etherum blockchain. It introduces you with wiriting smart contracts and other basics of solidity.

## **First Smart Contract**

Before writing the "First smart contract" I learnt about the different versions of the Solidity and then about the variables type. This contract simply allows you to print your message to the user with a globally assigned variable. 

#

## **Modifiers in Solidity**

In the modifiers program I have used the constructor, functions and the data hiding method to allow the contract accessible to only a specific user.

## **View vs Pure**
